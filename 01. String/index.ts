let myName: string = "Anish Uikey";
console.log(myName); // ðŸ‘‰ Anish Uikey

// Error 
// myName: string = 11

myName = "Something Else"
console.log(myName); //ðŸ‘‰ Something Else 

// Why because above code first it declared myName variable as 'Anish uikey' and after that it become 'Something Else';
